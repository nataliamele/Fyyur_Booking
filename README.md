Fyyur
-----

### Introduction

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

Your job is to build out the data models to power the API endpoints for the Fyyur site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues on Fyyur.

### Tech Stack

* **SQLAlchemy ORM** ORM library
* **PostgreSQL** database 
* **Python3** and **Flask** as our server language and server framework
* **Flask-Migrate** for creating and running schema migrations
* **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** with [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/) for our website's frontend

### Main Files: Project Structure

  ```sh
  ├── README.md
  ├── app.py *** the main driver of the app. Includes your SQLAlchemy models.
                    "python app.py" to run after installing dependences
  ├── config.py *** Database URLs, CSRF generation, etc
  ├── error.log
  ├── forms.py ***  forms
  ├── models.py *** models
  ├── requirements.txt *** The dependencies we need to install with "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"

  └── templates

      ├── layouts
      └── pages
  ```

Overall:
* Models are located in the `models.py`.
* Controllers are also located in `app.py`.
* The web frontend is located in `templates/`, which builds static assets deployed to the web server at `static/`.
* Web forms for creating data are located in `form.py`


Highlight folders:
* `templates/pages` -- Defines the pages that are rendered to the site. These templates render views based on data passed into the template’s view, in the controllers defined in `app.py`. These pages successfully represent the data to the user, and are already defined for you.
* `templates/layouts` -- Defines the layout that a page can be contained in to define footer and header code for a given page.
* `templates/forms` -- Defines the forms used to create new artists, shows, and venues.
* `app.py` -- Defines routes that match the user’s URL, and controllers which handle data and renders views to the user. This is the main file you will be working on to connect to and manipulate the database and render views with data to the user, based on the URL.
* Models in `models.py` -- Defines the data models that set up the database tables.
* `config.py` -- Stores configuration variables and instructions, separate from the main application code. This is where you will need to connect to the database.



Functionallity and Acceptance Criteria
-----

1. The web app should be successfully connected to a PostgreSQL database. A local connection to a database on your local computer is fine.
2. There should be no use of mock data throughout the app. The data structure of the mock data per controller should be kept unmodified when satisfied by real data.
3. The application should behave just as before with mock data, but now uses real data from a real backend server, with real search functionality. For example:
  * when a user submits a new artist record, the user should be able to see it populate in /artists, as well as search for the artist by name and have the search return results.
  * I should be able to go to the URL `/artist/<artist-id>` to visit a particular artist’s page using a unique ID per artist, and see real data about that particular artist.
  * Venues should continue to be displayed in groups by city and state.
  * Search should be allowed to be partial string matching and case-insensitive.
  * Past shows versus Upcoming shows should be distinguished in Venue and Artist pages.
  * A user should be able to click on the venue for an upcoming show in the Artist's page, and on that Venue's page, see the same show in the Venue Page's upcoming shows section.
4. As a fellow developer on this application, I should be able to run `flask db migrate`, and have my local database (once set up and created) be populated with the right tables to run this application and have it interact with my local postgres server, serving the application's needs completely with real data I can seed my local database with.
  * The models should be completed (see TODOs in the `Models` section of `app.py`) and model the objects used throughout Fyyur.
  * The right _type_ of relationship and parent-child dynamics between models should be accurately identified and fit the needs of this particular application.
  * The relationship between the models should be accurately configured, and referential integrity amongst the models should be preserved.
  * `flask db migrate` should work, and populate my local postgres database with properly configured tables for this application's objects, including proper columns, column data types, constraints, defaults, and relationships that completely satisfy the needs of this application. The proper type of relationship between venues, artists, and shows should be configured.

##### Stand Out

Looking to go above and beyond? This is the right section for you! Here are some challenges to make your submission stand out:

*  Implement artist availability. An artist can list available times that they can be booked. Restrict venues from being able to create shows with artists during a show time that is outside of their availability.
* Show Recent Listed Artists and Recently Listed Venues on the homepage, returning results for Artists and Venues sorting by newly created. Limit to the 10 most recently listed items.
* Implement Search Artists by City and State, and Search Venues by City and State. Searching by "San Francisco, CA" should return all artists or venues in San Francisco, CA.

Best of luck in your final project! Fyyur depends on you!

### Development Setup

First, [install Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/#install-flask) if you haven't already.

  ```
  $ cd ~
  $ sudo pip3 install Flask
  ```

To start and run the local development server,

1. Initialize and activate a virtualenv:
  ```
  $ cd YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY_PATH/
  $ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
  $ source env/bin/activate
  ```

2. Install the dependencies:
  ```
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. Run the development server:
  ```
  $ export FLASK_APP=myapp
  $ export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
  $ python3 app.py
  ```

4. Navigate to Home page [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
